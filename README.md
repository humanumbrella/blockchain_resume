# blockchain_resume
A project to 'mine' a resume like a blockchain

#backstory
So I had an idea that I should mess around with a blockchain to make sure I understood blocks and the chained aspect. This project creates a Block, a BlockChain, and you can submit a CSV to create the blockchain that is you. You can also choose your letter and difficulty for the blockhashes.

Including an example.

Open Resume.py and add your details, maybe csv import at some point... 
choose char (repeating character), length (difficulty), and genYear (genesis)

Run Resume.py and watch the mining start.
